"""CUDA-Q Algorithms.

The package has two kinds of components:

- Compiled bindings (``_pycudaq_algorithms``): C++-backed APIs such as the
  fermion and state-preparation utilities. These require the native
  extension built against CUDA-Q.
- Pure-Python modules (:mod:`.pauli_lcu`, :mod:`.qubitization`, :mod:`.qsvt`,
  :mod:`.trotter`, :mod:`.sim_utils`): quantum primitives implemented as
  CUDA-Q Python kernels. These only require the ``cudaq`` Python package.
- Pure-Python classical preprocessing (:mod:`.double_factorization`):
  chemistry-oriented numerics on NumPy/SciPy with optional CuPy GPU
  acceleration. The subpackage itself imports neither ``cudaq`` nor the
  compiled extension, but it is reached through this package, whose
  import does load ``cudaq`` alongside it.

The native extension is optional: if it is not present (for example in a
source checkout without a build), the pure-Python APIs below still import
and work. Code that needs the compiled APIs will raise ``ImportError`` at
the point of use instead of at package import.
"""

# The absence of the compiled extension is tolerated (source checkouts
# without a build); a PRESENT-but-broken extension is not — an extension
# that fails to load (ABI mismatch, missing shared-library dependency)
# re-raises with the loader's message instead of silently degrading.
