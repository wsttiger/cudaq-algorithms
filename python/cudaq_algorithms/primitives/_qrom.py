"""QROM: coherent classical-table lookup, two constructions in one surface.

``QROM(data, address_bits, output_bits)`` mints the lookup
``|k>|y> -> |k>|y XOR data[k]>`` behind one kernel signature
``(address: qview, ladder: qview, output: qview)`` — all little-endian
(qubit 0 = LSB, ``docs/conventions.md``), ``ladder`` being ``num_ladder``
clean ancillas (|0> in, |0> out). Addresses ``k >= len(data)`` read as
zero. Two constructions sit behind ``variant=``:

- ``"select"`` — the plain unary-iteration QROM (Babbush et al.,
  `arXiv:1805.03662`): one fused tree walk over the address register
  whose per-address body CNOTs the set bits of ``data[k]`` into the
  output. ``num_ladder = address_bits``.
- ``"select_swap"`` — SELECT-SWAP / QROAM (Low, Kliuchnikov, Schaeffer,
  `arXiv:1812.00954`): the table is split into ``ceil(N / B)`` blocks of
  ``B = block_size`` entries; one unary-iteration walk over the *block
  index* (the high ``address_bits - log2(B)`` address bits) writes the
  visited block's ``B`` entries into ``B`` clean ``output_bits``-wide
  block registers, a swap network controlled on the low ``log2(B)``
  address bits routes the selected entry's register into block slot 0,
  and CNOTs copy slot 0 into the output. The routing and the writes are
  then undone unitarily. ``num_ladder = (address_bits - log2(B)) +
  B * output_bits`` (walk lines first, then the block registers).
- ``"auto"`` (default) — price both variants (and every power-of-two
  ``block_size``) with the exact Toffoli model below and take the
  cheapest, preferring ``"select"`` on ties (fewer ancillas).

Toffoli accounting (documented contract, pinned by the resource tests;
``W(n, m)`` is the fused walk count from
:mod:`cudaq_algorithms.primitives._unary_iteration`, ``3 * 2^n / 2 - 5``
on full uncontrolled trees):

- ``"select"``: ``W(address_bits, len(data))``.
- ``"select_swap"``: ``2 * W(address_bits - log2(B), ceil(len(data)/B))
  + 2 * output_bits * (B - 1)``. Each controlled register swap is
  ``output_bits`` Fredkins, each Fredkin one Toffoli plus two CNOTs; the
  binary routing network is ``B - 1`` register swaps per direction, and
  both the routing and the block writes run twice (compute + unitary
  uncompute).

The papers' headline counts (``N - 1`` lookup Toffolis for SELECT,
``ceil(N/B) + output_bits * (B - 1)`` for QROAM) price ancilla
uncomputation at zero via measurement-and-fixup. These primitives stay
strictly unitary (house rules: statevector-testable, inverse-composable,
no mid-circuit measurement), so the coherent counts above are what the
minted kernels actually cost; the default ``block_size`` optimizes the
coherent model (``~ sqrt(3 N / (2 output_bits))`` rather than the
papers' ``~ sqrt(N / output_bits)``).

Both variants are exactly their own inverse: the write phase is X-only,
so the ``"select"`` walk XORs the same table twice, and the
``"select_swap"`` sandwich ``U = W S C S^-1 W`` squares to identity
(``W`` and ``C`` are involutions and the copy commutes with itself
through the routing). Apply ``kernel()`` again to uncompute; the
property is pinned by ``tests/python/test_primitives_qrom.py``.

    ----------
    data
        The table: non-negative integers, one per address, each fitting
        in ``output_bits`` bits.
    address_bits
        Address register width (``len(data) <= 2^address_bits``).
    output_bits
        Output register width.
    variant
        ``"auto"`` (default), ``"select"`` or ``"select_swap"`` — see the
        module docstring for the constructions and their exact prices.
    block_size
        SELECT-SWAP block size: a power of two in
        ``[2, 2^(address_bits - 1)]``. Only valid with
        ``variant="select_swap"``; ``None`` there picks the power of two

    requirement between them), which is what lets callers weave the QROM
    into their own ancilla layouts. Whatever the variant, the kernel is
    exactly self-inverse — apply it again to uncompute.
