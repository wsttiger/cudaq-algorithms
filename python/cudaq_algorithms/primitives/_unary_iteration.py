"""Unary iteration: apply a per-address body once for each address value.

``unary_iteration_kernels`` mints a flat device kernel that walks a binary
tree over the address register (Babbush et al., `arXiv:1805.03662`,
Fig. 7): one clean ladder ancilla per address bit carries the "this
subtree is active" line, and the caller's body gates for address ``k``
fire controlled on the leaf line — i.e. exactly when the address register
equals ``k``. The walk descends once, iterates the leaves in address
order, and retraces once; sibling transitions reuse the parent line with
a CNOT, and deeper transitions fuse the uncompute of the old path with
the compute of the new one through a single guard Toffoli on
CNOT-conjugated address wires.

Toffoli cost (unitary-uncompute accounting — see below): a full tree of
``N = 2^num_address_bits`` addresses costs exactly ``3 N / 2 - 5``
Toffolis uncontrolled (``N >= 8``; 2 at ``N = 4``, 0 at ``N = 2``) and
``3 N / 2 - 1`` controlled. Partial trees (``num_items < N``) cost less;
the emitter reports the exact number as ``toffoli_count``. The paper's
headline count for unary iteration is ``N - 1`` Toffolis, but that
figure prices the AND-ancilla *uncomputation* at zero via
measurement-and-fixup. This library keeps every primitive strictly
unitary (statevector-testable, inverse-composable, no mid-circuit
measurement), and with unitary uncomputation the fused walk's
``3 N / 2 + O(1)`` is the best we found: an exhaustive search over
CNOT/Toffoli circuits (arbitrary CNOT-conjugated controls, dirty address
wires, extra ancillas) proves 2 Toffolis minimal for the controlled
two-address walk, 5 for the controlled four-address walk and 2 for the
uncontrolled four-address walk — all matched by this construction, and
all above the measurement-assisted ``N - 1``. The naive
compute/uncompute walk costs ``2 N - 4``.

The callback pattern (READ THIS — it is the template for QROM and for
factory-composed SELECTs)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CUDA-Q kernels are compiled from fixed Python source, so a callback can
never execute *inside* a kernel. The callback therefore runs at **factory
time**: ``body(k)`` is called once per address on the host and must return
the gate list for that address as data. The emitter flattens the whole
tree walk (ladder gadgets + body gates) into parallel opcode/operand
integer lists, and the minted kernel is a single flat interpreter loop
over those captured lists. Flatness is load-bearing: CUDA-Q's
control-variant generation rejects kernels that call other kernels, so
anything built this way stays ``cudaq.control``-compatible and can sit
inside a controlled SELECT.

Body instruction set. Each item is a tuple whose head names the gate;
``target``/``work`` operands index the target/work registers. The three
original gates are implicitly controlled on the address-``k`` leaf line:

- ``("x", t)`` / ``("y", t)`` / ``("z", t)`` — leaf-controlled Pauli on
  ``target[t]``.

The extended vocabulary (for SELECTs whose term unitaries are
multi-controlled bit flips and phases) has two families. *Free* gates
carry **no** leaf control and execute for every address — they are only
sound as conjugation pairs closed inside the same body (pre-ops,
leaf-controlled core, reversed pre-ops), where they cancel exactly on
inactive addresses:

- ``("free_x", t)`` — ``x(target[t])``;
- ``("free_cx", a, b)`` — ``cx(target[a], target[b])``;
- ``("and_tt", a, b, w)`` — Toffoli ``target[a], target[b] -> work[w]``;
- ``("and_wt", v, t, w)`` — Toffoli ``work[v], target[t] -> work[w]``;
- ``("copy_tw", t, w)`` — ``cx(target[t], work[w])``.

Leaf-referencing core gates:

- ``("x_w", w, t)`` — ``x.ctrl(leaf, work[w], target[t])``;
- ``("z_w", w)`` — ``z.ctrl(leaf, work[w])``;
- ``("sign",)`` — ``z(leaf)``: a ``-1`` phase exactly on the
  address-``k`` branch (term-sign carrier).

Any body that uses ``work`` operands makes the minted kernels take a
trailing ``work: qview`` (clean, |0> in / |0> out — each body must
uncompute its own work usage); ``num_work`` on the result records the
required width (0 means no work view in the signature).

Kernel signatures (all registers little-endian, qubit 0 = LSB, per
``docs/conventions.md``):

- ``kernel(address: qview, ladder: qview, target: qview[, work: qview])``
  — walk with the body applied at each active address (the ``work`` view
  appears only when ``num_work > 0``).
- with ``controlled=True``: the same signatures with a leading
  ``control: qview``, a one-qubit view rooting the tree — the whole walk
  acts as the identity when the control is |0>. (A separate one-qubit
  view, not a leading qubit of a combined register, so callers never mix
  a qview with a bare qubit in one control set. Free body gates still
  execute at control |0>, but their conjugation pairing cancels them.)

``kernel_adj`` is the hand-written inverse (``cudaq.adjoint`` is
off-limits, cuda-quantum#4897/#4898): every emitted gate is self-inverse
(X/CX/CCX and controlled Paulis), so the inverse is the same interpreter
over the reversed instruction list. When the body gates at every address
mutually commute and square to identity (e.g. the X-only QROM write), the
walk itself is an involution and ``include_adjoint=False`` skips minting
the redundant inverse.

The walk circuit
----------------

Level ``r`` (1-based, from the root) examines address bit
``address[num_address_bits - r]`` (level 1 = MSB) and owns ladder line
``ladder[r - 1]``; the invariant at leaf ``k`` is that ``ladder[r - 1]``
holds the indicator "top ``r`` address bits equal those of ``k``" (AND
the external control, if any), so the leaf/body line is always
``ladder[num_address_bits - 1]``. The transition from leaf ``k`` to
``k + 1`` (with ``t`` trailing ones in ``k``, flip level ``d = n - t``):

- ``t = 0``: one CNOT from the parent line onto the leaf line — exactly
  one of the two siblings is active given the parent, so their XOR is
  the parent itself.
- ``t >= 1``: unclamp levels ``n .. d + 2`` with Toffolis against the
  still-old parents, XOR the fused difference
  ``guard AND (bit_d XOR bit_{d+1})`` into level ``d + 1`` with a single
  Toffoli on a CNOT-conjugated address wire (the old and new level-
  ``(d+1)`` indicators are disjoint given the guard, so their XOR
  factors), CNOT-flip level ``d``, and reclamp levels ``d + 2 .. n``
  against the new parents: ``2 t - 1`` Toffolis. When the flip level is
  the unguarded root, the fused difference is linear (free CNOTs) and
  the first reclamp pair collapses into one Toffoli on two conjugated
  address wires: ``max(2 t - 3, 0)`` Toffolis.
