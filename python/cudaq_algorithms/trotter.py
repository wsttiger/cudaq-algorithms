"""Suzuki-Trotter Hamiltonian simulation.

Product-formula time evolution for Hamiltonians expressed as sums of Pauli
strings: term extraction, host-side planning and ordering, resource
estimation, and the circuit primitive itself.

The typical workflow constructs a ``Trotter`` object (term extraction,
validation, and ordering happen once) and either uses its kernel
factories or composes the ``apply_trotter`` primitive inside a custom
kernel::

    from cudaq_algorithms import trotter

    evolution = trotter.Trotter(hamiltonian)
    kernel = evolution.kernel(time=0.8, steps=4, order=2)  # @cudaq.kernel()
    resources = evolution.resources(steps=4, order=2)

Identity terms: for ``H = c I + H'``, ``apply_trotter`` implements the
product formula for ``H'`` only. The omitted ``exp(-i c t)`` is an
unobservable global phase for one unconditioned evolution but a real
relative phase for controlled or interference-based algorithms;
``identity_coefficient`` is reported on the ``Trotter`` object so callers
can account for it (the simulation helper ``sim_utils.evolve``
reintroduces it host-side).
