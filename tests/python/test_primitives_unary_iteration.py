"""Tests for the fused unary-iteration walk.

Two layers of evidence. The emitted instruction tape is verified
*classically and exhaustively* (every address width up to 6, every
partial-tree size, controlled and uncontrolled) by tracking each ladder
line as a Boolean truth table over the address bits: at every body slot
the leaf line must be the exact address-``k`` indicator, and at the end
the ladder must be zero and the address wires restored — that is the
full circuit identity "walk == SELECT". The minted kernels are then
pinned on the statevector: per-address phase kicks (including partial
trees), the Y-body sign convention, the hand-written inverse against
non-commuting bodies, and the externally controlled variant at |0> and
|1>.
