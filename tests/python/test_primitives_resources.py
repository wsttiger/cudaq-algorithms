"""Compiler-pinned Toffoli costs of the primitives.

The fused unary-iteration walk documents an exact unitary Toffoli count
(``3 N / 2 - 5`` on full uncontrolled trees of ``N >= 8`` addresses,
``3 N / 2 - 1`` controlled) and QROM documents an exact price for each
variant. These tests hold those claims against the compiler rather than
the emitter: ``cudaq.estimate_resources`` counts the ``ccx`` operations
actually synthesized, which (a) must equal the emitter's bookkeeping —
a multi-control expansion or a decomposition surprise would break the
equality — and (b) must equal the documented closed forms, with the
per-doubling *increment* (not the ratio: affine costs approach their
asymptote from above) making the O(N) scaling directly visible.

The papers' headline counts (``N - 1`` for unary iteration in
arXiv:1805.03662, ``ceil(N/B) + b (B - 1)`` for QROAM in
arXiv:1812.00954) assume measurement-based ancilla uncomputation; the
strictly unitary counts pinned here are the honest coherent prices.

``estimate_resources`` traces the kernel without executing it, so no
simulator target or tolerance is involved; every assertion is an exact
integer comparison.
