# CUDA-Q Algorithms

CUDA-Q Algorithms is a primitive-first algorithms library built on CUDA-Q,
focused on fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) primitives.

It imports selected reusable functionality from `cudaqx/libs/solvers`:

- fermion-to-qubit transforms
- state-preparation circuits
- state-preparation excitation/operator-pool helpers

NISQ-era application workflows such as VQE, ADAPT-VQE, QAOA, GQE, PySCF drivers,
and optimizer loops are intentionally out of scope for this library and will not
be ported; they remain available in `cudaqx/libs/solvers`.

## Python primitives

`cudaq_algorithms` is a pure-Python package implemented as CUDA-Q Python
kernels and host-side helpers (the only runtime requirement is the
`cudaq` Python package):

- fermion-to-qubit transforms (`fermion.jordan_wigner`,
  `fermion.bravyi_kitaev`)
- state-preparation kernels and operator pools (`stateprep`)
- Pauli LCU block encoding (`PauliLCU`, plus prepare/select/apply kernels)
- qubitization walks and Chebyshev moment measurement (`Walk`)
- QSVT phase sequences (`QSVT`, `PhaseSequence`)
- Suzuki-Trotter product formulas (`trotter.Trotter`, orders 1/2/4)

Simulation-only helpers (statevector access) are isolated in
`cudaq_algorithms.sim_utils`; everything else is hardware-shaped. See
[docs/pauli_lcu_qsvt.md](docs/pauli_lcu_qsvt.md),
[docs/trotter.md](docs/trotter.md),
[docs/stateprep.md](docs/stateprep.md),
[examples/pauli_lcu_qsvt/](examples/pauli_lcu_qsvt/),
[examples/hamiltonian_simulation/](examples/hamiltonian_simulation/), and
[examples/stateprep/](examples/stateprep/).

Classical chemistry preprocessing ships as a peer pure-Python module:
double factorization of two-electron integrals (X-DF and C-DF/RC-DF) on
NumPy/SciPy with optional CuPy GPU acceleration — see
[docs/double_factorization.md](docs/double_factorization.md).

## Chemistry Inputs

CUDA-Q Algorithms does not provide an official bridge to PySCF or any other
electronic-structure package. Chemistry-facing tests and examples may use PySCF
to generate reference data, such as one- and two-electron integrals, but that
dependency stays at the test/example boundary.

The library APIs operate on reusable algorithmic inputs, such as one- and
two-body tensors, qubit Hamiltonians, Pauli words, and state-preparation
operator pools.
