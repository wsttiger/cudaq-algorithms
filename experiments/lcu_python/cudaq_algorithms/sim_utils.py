"""Simulation-only helpers.

Everything here depends on statevector access (``cudaq.get_state`` /
postselection slicing), which only exists on simulators. The module ships
with the package as a clearly-labeled companion, but it is not part of the
hardware-shaped API: the library classes (encodings, kernel factories,
observables, ``Walk.moment`` via ``cudaq.observe``) never execute
``get_state``.
